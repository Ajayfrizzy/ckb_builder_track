**Name:** Oluwaseun Ajao
**Week Ending:** 01-07-2026

## Courses Completed

- Completed the first **two modules** of the CKB Academy:
  - **CKB Theoretical Knowledge**:
    - Structure of a cell
    - Structure of a transaction
  - **Reading [RFC 0022](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md)** on Transaction Structure:
    - Deep dive into `cell_deps`, `witnesses`, `lock` and `type` scripts
- Studied sections 1, 2, and 3 of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

### Key Learnings

- Developed a detailed understanding of the **UTXO-based transaction model in CKB**, including:
  - The role and structure of **witnesses**, **lock scripts**, and **type scripts**
  - How **script grouping** and **syscalls** function within the CKB-VM execution environment
- Learned some **Rust** elementary notions:
  - Variables and mutability
  - Functions
  - Data types

## Practical Progress

- **Set up a local CKB dev node** successfully
- Began using CLI tools(Wallet):
  - `get-capacity`
  - `transfer`
  - `get-live-cells`
- Wrote and ran a **Rust Codes** to begin learning Rust for on-chain development

## Environment

- CKB node and local dev environment installed and functional
- Basic CLI usage and debugging started
- Rust and Cargo installed
