# **Nervos DAO Deposit and Withdraw RFC**

The Nervos DAO is a smart contract on the CKB blockchain that provides a dilution counter-measure for CKByte (CKB) holders. By depositing CKB into the DAO, users can earn proportional secondary issuance rewards, ensuring their holdings are only affected by the hard-capped primary issuance (similar to Bitcoin's model).

- Key Learnings
    - **Dilution Protection**: Counters the dilution effect from CKB's secondary issuance
    - **Time-based Deposits**: Minimum deposit period counted in blocks
    - **Automatic Renewal**: Deposits automatically enter new periods if not withdrawn
    - **Two-Phase Withdrawal**: Secure withdrawal process with compensation calculation
- CKB Token Issuance Model
CKB has a dual issuance model:
    1. **Primary Issuance**: Hard-capped issuance for miners (same curve as Bitcoin)
    2. **Secondary Issuance**: Constant issuance per epoch (rate approaches zero over time)
